# React Topics: Definitions, Syntax, and Examples

## React Definition

**React** is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the application's state efficiently.


## Key Features

- **Component-based architecture**: React allows developers to build encapsulated components that manage their own state and can be composed to make complex UIs.
- **Declarative**: React makes it easy to design interactive UIs by efficiently updating and rendering components when your data changes.
- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to improve performance by updating only parts of the actual DOM that need to be changed, rather than reloading the entire page.
- **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: React uses JSX, which allows you to write HTML elements within JavaScript code. JSX makes the code easier to understand and write.

## Advantages

- **Reusable components**: React allows developers to create reusable UI components, which can be shared across different parts of an application.
- **Faster rendering**: The virtual DOM ensures that React apps are fast, as it minimizes direct interaction with the actual DOM.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: React has a strong community and many third-party libraries that make development easier and faster.

## Basic Example

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

# How to Create a React App

Follow these steps to create a new React app.

## 1. Install Node.js and npm
Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed. You can download and install them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

After installation, verify it by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## 2. Install `create-react-app`
`create-react-app` is a tool that sets up a new React project with a good default configuration. To install it globally, run:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

## 3. Create a New React App
Once the tool is installed, you can create a new React project by running:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

## 4. Navigate to the Project Directory

After the React app is created, move into your project folder using the following command:

```bash
cd my-app
```

## 5. Start the Development Server

To start the React development server, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

## Topics

### 1. Layout

**Definition**: Layout involves structuring the UI using components, CSS, and grid/flexbox techniques.  
**Example**:
```jsx
function Layout() {
    return (
        <div className="container">
            <header>Header</header>
            <main>Main Content</main>
            <footer>Footer</footer>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### 2. `useMemo` Hook
**Definition**: `useMemo` memoizes a value so that it is recalculated only when its dependencies change.  
**Syntax**:
```jsx
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => {// function logic}, [dependencies]);
```

### 3. `useCallback` Hook
**Definition**: The `useCallback` hook returns a memoized version of the callback function, preventing unnecessary re-creations of the function during re-renders.  
**Syntax**:
```jsx
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {// Your callback function logic here}, [dependencies]);
